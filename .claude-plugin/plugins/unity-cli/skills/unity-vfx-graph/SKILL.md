# Visual Effect Graph

Author and inspect `.vfx` Visual Effect Graph assets: read a graph's contexts, blocks, operators and parameters, discover the node library, and apply authoring mutations. The VFX authoring API is internal to Unity, so these operations run through dedicated bridge tools (`vfx_*`) rather than direct component edits. This skill is the VFX complement to `unity-asset-management`, which handles generic asset, material, and import operations.

## Use When

- The user wants to inspect a `.vfx` graph's structure (contexts, blocks, operators, parameters, links, layout).
- The user wants to discover which blocks, operators, contexts, or templates are available.
- The user wants to build or modify a graph: add/remove/link nodes, set values and settings, manage the blackboard, systems, events, subgraphs, sticky notes, groups, or canvas layout.
- The user wants to verify a graph compiles, or find out why it does not.
- The user wants to drive an exposed parameter on a live `VisualEffect` (`vfx_runtime`), read/write VFX project settings or editor preferences (`vfx_settings`), or bake a Mesh into an SDF Texture3D (`vfx_bake_sdf`).

## Do Not Use When

- The task is generic asset, material, or import work; use `unity-asset-management`.
- The request is about editing arbitrary serialized fields on a scene component; use `unity-gameobject-edit`. (`vfx_runtime` is only for VisualEffect public-API calls like `SetFloat`/`SendEvent`.)
- The work is play-mode lifecycle control or input simulation; use `unity-playmode-testing`.

## Preferred Flow

1. **Baseline.** `vfx_describe_graph` before mutating. Note the three oracles it carries: `errors` (validation + compile errors, on by default), `compile` (outcome of the last recompile), and `layout` (`overlapCount` + overlapping node pairs). Write down the baseline `overlapCount`: a hand-made graph often has a non-zero one (node sizes are estimated generously), and your job is to not add to it.
2. **Discover names.** `vfx_list_library` with `kind` (`block` default, `operator`, `context`, `parameter`, `template`) and a `filter` whenever you are not certain of an exact descriptor name — the leading `|` and `|_` separators in names like `|Set|_Color` are load-bearing.
3. **Mutate narrowly** with `vfx_apply`, one op at a time. **Every op response carries `compile.success`; read it.** If it is `false`, the graph no longer compiles — `compile.exception` / `compile.errors` / `compile.logs` say why. Fix that before doing anything else; never stack more ops on a broken graph. An op that returns `error` was not applied at all.
4. **Place what you added — mandatory; move nothing else.** Add ops only keep a new node off existing ones. Before you report, run `vfx_apply op:"auto_layout"`. Its default scope, `nodes`, places only the nodes created this session — operators, and a parameter canvas node for every link made from a parameter — in free space directly left of what they feed, aligned with the consuming block's row and stacked per consumer, and moves nothing that existed before. (One exception, reported as `shiftedDown`: a context that grew over the next context of its own system pushes that lower part of the system down, vertically only, as a person would.) A person's canvas is theirs: re-laying out a whole system for one added block is never the right answer. Pass `scope:"touched"` (re-lay out every system edited this session), `scope:"all"`, or `contexts:[…]` only when the user asks for a tidy-up.
5. **Box the feature with its note.** A person keeps the nodes of one feature in a group box with a sticky note explaining it; do the same for what you added: `group_nodes` with your new nodes and `note:{title, contents}` creates the box and the note inside it (left of the members). Read `nonMembersInside` in the response — if the box swallows nodes that are not yours, move your own nodes closer together (`move_node`; nodes created this session move freely) and run `group_nodes` again, or drop the box and keep just the note. A block cannot be grouped; name it in the note.
6. **Verify and only then report.** Re-run `vfx_describe_graph` and confirm all three: `compile.success == true`, no `errors[]` entry with `type: "Error"`, and `layout.overlapCount` no higher than your baseline with no listed overlap involving a node you created (on a graph you built from scratch that means `0`). Quote those three facts in your completion report. (`get_compilation_state` is C# script compilation and says nothing about a VFX graph; use `compile` / describe instead.)

Invocation: every tool runs as `unity-cli raw <tool> --json '<json>'`. Add `--output json` for a structured (parseable) result, and `--port <N>` to target a specific bridge (default `6400`).

```bash
unity-cli raw vfx_describe_graph --json '{"assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx"}'
unity-cli raw vfx_list_library --json '{"kind":"block","filter":"turbulence"}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"add_block","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx","contextType":"Update","blockName":"Turbulence","settings":{"NoiseType":"Perlin"}}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"add_operator","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx","operatorName":"Multiply"}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"link_slots","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx","from":{"node":"operator","operatorIndex":0,"slot":0},"to":{"node":"block","contextType":"Update","blockIndex":0,"slot":0}}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"add_parameter","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx","parameterName":"Rate","type":"Float","value":42.5,"min":0,"max":100}'

unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"add_block","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx","contextType":"Update","blockName":"Turbulence","autoCompile":false}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"compile","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx"}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"auto_layout","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx"}'
unity-cli raw vfx_apply --json '{"op":"group_nodes","assetPath":"Assets/FX/Burst.vfx","title":"Liquid turbulence","nodes":[{"node":"parameter","parameterIndex":12},{"node":"operator","operatorIndex":3}],"note":{"title":"Liquid turbulence","contents":"Relative-mode Perlin turbulence: Drag pulls velocity toward the noise field."}}'
```

## Hard Rules

- **Describe narrowly on a big graph.** An unfiltered `vfx_describe_graph` on a real graph is huge — a working hand-made graph returns ~450 KB (~112K tokens), which will swamp your context. Pass `includeSlots:false` to drop the slot trees that dominate it (-61%), and `include:[...]` to keep only the top-level sections you need (`include:["errors"]` + `includeSlots:false` is ~1K tokens). Counts and `assetPath` always survive, and `slotsOmitted:true` marks a filtered read so empty slot arrays are never mistaken for "no slots". Use the full describe only when you actually need slot values.
- **Batch edits with `autoCompile:false`.** Every op recompiles by default, and the cost grows with the graph — 20 `add_block` ops cost ~34s eagerly and ~8s deferred (4.4x). Pass `autoCompile:false` on each op in a run of edits, then one `vfx_apply op:"compile"` to flush (it reports `flushedDeferred`). **Deferred edits live in memory until that compile** — a domain reload (script recompile, play-mode enter) before it discards them, so keep a deferred run short and always close it with `compile`. A deferred op response carries `compile.deferred:true` instead of a compile summary, so rule 3 above (read `compile.success`) applies to the flushing `compile` call instead.
- **Custom HLSL operator: at most 4 inputs.** A VFX expression takes at most 4 parents, so a Custom HLSL *operator* whose function has 5+ parameters makes the asset stop compiling. `set_operator_setting`/`add_operator` refuse such a function with a clear error; pack inputs into `float2/3/4` or split the function. Custom HLSL *blocks* have no such limit.
- **Addressing.** Block ops take `contextType` (first context of that type) **or** `contextIndex` (absolute index from describe). Context ops (`set_context_setting`, `remove_context`, `delete_system`, `set_system_name`, `set_bounds`, `link_flow`/`unlink_flow` endpoints) take `contextType` or `index` — `contextIndex` is accepted as an alias everywhere. Prefer the index whenever a graph has two contexts of the same type.
- **New nodes take open space.** Add/duplicate/insert ops and `add_sticky_note` refuse to drop a node on an existing one: if the spot is taken (auto or explicit `position`) the node is moved to the nearest free space and the response says `positionAdjusted: true`. Read the returned `position` rather than assuming the one you asked for.
- **Existing nodes are the person's.** The default `auto_layout` (`scope:"nodes"`) never moves a node that existed before your session. The whole-system passes (`touched`/`all`/`contexts`) keep every existing context's x and only re-stack vertically; `move_node` on such a context keeps x and says so in `note`. Only a system you created this session is placed in a fresh column.
- **Short edges over shared nodes.** Do not route one parameter node or operator across the canvas to many consumers. Give far-apart consumers their own parameter canvas node and put cheap operators beside the system they feed. The `nodes` pass gives every parameter link you made a node within reach of its consumer; the whole-system passes also duplicate shared operators (`duplicateShared`, `splitParameters`), so operator indices can change after them — re-describe before addressing by index.
- **Linked slots ignore constants.** `set_slot_value` on a linked input warns (`warning`) — `unlink_slots` first if you meant the constant.
- **Parameters must be used to survive.** An exposed parameter that feeds nothing is stripped at compile and invisible at runtime (`vfx_runtime` `hasFloat:false`).
- **`|Set|_X` / `Get|_X` descriptors** compose attribute blocks/operators; custom attributes are declared with `add_custom_attribute` and then targeted with `set_block_setting setting:"attribute"`.
